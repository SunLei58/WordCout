Any community is composed of individuals. Naturally, it matters a great deal to our communities that we have a sense of responsibility towards them.
People living in the same area should be considered a group under an obligation to create a comfortable living environment for the whole community. Reaching this goal requires a sense of responsibility among all residents, which encourages them to start with small steps, such as to avoid making excessive noise that disturbs their neighbors. Moreover, a sense of collective responsibility among us students contributes to a warm and friendly atmosphere, where we respect and help each other, as well as a strong communal sense of belonging. It will ultimately be conducive to our academic and moral progress. After we graduate from college and get employed, we will find ourselves in a new community made up of colleagues. A sense of community responsibility, also known as team spirit in the workplace, will be the key to forming a united and cohesive group, where we strive towards a common objective in close cooperation with each other.
In conclusion, a sense of community responsibility is worth fostering in that it plays a significant role in living, learning and working.
